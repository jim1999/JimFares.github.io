# Power BI Dashboard Projects

## Overview

The GOC Travel Expenses Dashboard is a data visualization project aimed at providing insights into the expenses spent by politicians and ministers over the last 5 years. This interactive dashboard offers a comprehensive view of political spending patterns, understanding external factors that affect spending (e.g. COVID-19) and allowing users to explore and understand the allocation of funds across different categories, politicians, and regions. The dashboard takes into account the top 5 spending institutions.
